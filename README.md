# Stackoverflow China Edition

## Project Overview

During our Object-Oriented Programming module's Teamwork week, we embarked on an exciting journey to develop a Stackoverflow replica Spring Boot Web API, inspired by the renowned Stackoverflow platform. Our project, affectionately dubbed "Stackoverflow China Edition," serves as our final team endeavor, showcasing our mastery of Java technologies.

## Project Highlights üöÄ

Get ready to immerse yourself in the world of Stackoverflow with our China-inspired clone! Our project empowers users to create and manage questions and answers, just like the original platform. Here's a sneak peek into our technology stack:

- **Backend Magic**: Harnessing the power of Java (Spring Boot 3), we've crafted a robust backend system to handle all your requests and responses with finesse.
- **Data Dynamo**: Behind the scenes, PostgreSQL works tirelessly to efficiently manage our vast database of questions and answers.
- **Frontend Tricks**: Empowered by React Vite, our frontend dazzles with lightning-fast performance and cutting-edge features, offering users an immersive experience like never before.
